The structure of this repository is organized as follows:
* ```all data murcia```: Real meteorological and ET0 data in the Region of Murcia, obtained from http://siam.imida.es/.
* ```forecastTest```: Forecast meterological data in the Region of Murcia, obtained from https://www.weatherbit.io/ and https://www.visualcrossing.com/.
* ```siar```: Real meteorological and ET0 data in Spain, obtained from https://servicio.mapa.gob.es/websiar/SeleccionParametrosMap.aspx?dst=1.
* ```ET0.ipynb```: The code to develop the experiment. The output of each cell is kept and all seeds are set to 123 for reproducibility.
